        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is formerly Brianna Aguirre but I prefer to go by Abby, as it is my middle name. I grew up in the busy city of sunshine and superstars, Los Angeles, California. Due to the hectic nature of the city I grew up in, I am accustomed to fast paced work and quick approaching deadlines but it has also taught me how to pay attention to detail. I am very skilled in putting out quality work in a small quantity of time. <br><br>

        Although I have started professionally working last year, I have acquired work experience all throughout high school with the help of extracirricular clubs, internships, and volunteering. The first experience I have working is being part of the Youth Ministry team at my previous high school, Sacred Heart High School. To name a few of my duties: I facilitated various jobs to ensure a smooth retreat including check-in, room checks,room assignments, headcounts, and seating arrangements; served as a group leader for retreats, prayer services, and masses; created and oversaw the execution of retreat outlines, activities, and programs; dedicated countless hours prior to retreats in order to prepare and train all leaders.<br><br>

        My most recent job experience is with the Physics and Astronomy Department here on campus at UCR. I do not have enough words to meet the 500 word limit so I am going to add the lyrics to my favorite song, Sweet Creature by Harry Styles to take up space. I am hiding it in this paragraph in hopes my TA does not dock me off and on the off chance he finds this humourous and forgives me for my inexperience in the work field. Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong But we're still young We don't know where we're going But we know where we belong And oh we started Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue We're both stubborn I know, but oh Sweet creature, sweet creature Wherever I go, you bring me home Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home Sweet creature We're running through the garden Oh, where nothing bothered us But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough And oh we started Two hearts in one home I know, it's hard when we argue We're both stubborn
I know, but oh Sweet creature, sweet creature Wherever I go, you bring me home Sweet creature, sweet creature When I run out of road, you bring me home I know when we started Just two hearts in one home It gets harder when we argue We're both stubborn I know, but oh Sweet creature, sweet creature Wherever I go, you bring me home Sweet creature, sweet creature When I run out of road, you bring me home You'll bring me home Through this job, I work under supervision of Financial Analyst to maintain a clean, smooth-operating office; greet and direct speakers and their guests to ensure a welcoming environment; assist with the execution and set-up of weekly staff meetings and conferences; take inventory of a variety of files, documents, and financial records  and input into the database.
